abstract = {Exergy (availability) is the amount of mechanical work that could be produced by reversible processes. This notion is revisited in the case when ambient temperature fluctuates. Simple examples are first considered, and then a theoretical approach is developed. It results that the most reliable way for combining entropy and total energy into an exergy function is a linear combination where entropy is multiplied by a constant temperature. It results that ambient air has non-zero exergy, but that exergy is surely conserved in ideal reversible processes. This approach is relevant for studying some recent problems in solar energy and building engineering.},

abstract = {In the energy realm there is a pressing need to make decisions in a complex world characterized by biophysical limits. Exergy has been promoted as a preferred means of characterizing the impacts of resource consumption and waste production for the purpose of improving decision-making. This paper provides a unique and critical analysis of universal and comprehensive formulations of the chemical exergy reference environment, for the purpose of better understanding how exergy can inform decision-making. Four related insights emerged from the analysis, notably: (1) standard and universal chemical exergy reference environments necessarily encounter internal inconsistencies and even contradictions in their very formulations; (2) these inconsistencies are a result of incompatibility between the exergy reference environment and natural environment, and the desire to model the exergy reference environment after the natural environment so as to maintain analytical relevance; (3) the topics for which exergy is most appropriate as an analytical tool are not well served by comprehensive reference environments, and (4) the inconsistencies point to a need for deeper reflection of whether it is appropriate to adopt {\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}na thermodynamic frame of analysis for situations whose relevant characteristics are {\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}nnon-thermodynamic (e.g., to characterize scarcity). The use of comprehensive reference environments may lead to incorrect recommendations and ultimately reduce its appeal for informing decision-making. Exergy may better inform decision-making by returning to process dependent reference states that model specific processes and situations for the purpose of engineering optimization.},

abstract = {Available energy is based on the Second Law and goes back to Maxwell and Gibbs. Unfortunately, it has not yet caught on in engineering practice, or in managerial decision-making. It is the available energy content of a substance, not its energy content, that truly represents the potential of the substance to cause change. Available energy is the only rational basis for evaluating (1) fuels and resources, (2) process, device, and system efficiencies, (3) dissipations and their costs, and (4) the value and cost of system outputs. This paper presents a brief overview of Thermodynamics and a description of the methodology of Second Law analysis. Some results from two case studies are given, which illustrate the efficiency analysis of a dual-duct HVAC system in Milwaukee and of a total energy power plant in Jersey City. While exposing many misconceptions resulting from energy analyses, the results of the efficiency analyses pinpoint the opportunities for improving energy systems, showing great potential for alleviating [`]the energy problem' via conservation. This potential for conservation lies not in the usual, negative concept of austerity ([`]belt-tightening'), but in a positive approach: the reduction of very large dissipations in the process that convert the resource to the desired form of [`]energy'. In turn, the analyses show how economic-analysis decisions regarding [`]energy' systems can be greatly facilitated, while avoiding the The efficiency analysis evaluates the inefficiencies in and the effluent losses from the various components misappropriations (often gross) that result from energy analyses. making up the systems: For the dual-duct system, (i) at summer design operating conditions, and (ii) at winter designs.

First, the general definition of the dead state is provided, based on the concept of ‘the available energy of a body' as originally presented by Gibbs. Gibbs ‘body' can be any overall system, no matter how complex and a crucial point is that there is no need to include or have a ‘reference environment.' On this groundwork, criteria underlying the selection of the appropriate dead state for a variety of practical engineering systems are referred to; while these cases are not exhaustive, they provide examples of the rationale for selection of an appropriate dead state for any case. Finally, the implications and relevance of the dead state on applications of exergy considerations to the issues of ecology and sustainability are discussed.},

abstract = {Thermal capacity of building partitions and their internal thermal structure, that is location of materials of different thermal conductivity, density and specific heat, have an influence on dynamics of the heat transfer processes, caused by external and internal thermal excitations. Dynamic thermal characteristics of building components, which determine the periodic heat transfer processes, are admittances, transmittances and periodic thermal capacities. In this paper, properties of the areal periodic heat capacity of interior and exterior building partitions are examined: its dependence on structure, thickness of masonry layers, surface film resistances and period of temperature variations, and also its asymptotic values for high thickness and low frequency. For wall assemblies composed of lightweight materials, and also for massive walls of very low thickness, approximate proportionality takes place. For heavy structures, the dependence becomes curvilinear, and for very thick walls tends to the constant value, attaining maximum for a comparatively low thickness which is approximately twice the periodic penetration depth. For exterior walls, dependence on the thermal mass factor, and also on thickness of the interior massive layer, has a similar character. Maximum periodic heat capacity for walls with insulation outside appears for thickness of the masonry layer of only 10-12 cm, which is approximately value of the periodic penetration depth.},

abstract = {In the exergy analysis of the built environment, particularly for a system with large heat capacity and low thermal conductivity, such as building envelopes, consideration of physics associated with the entropy and exergy storages is increasingly important. However, steady-state exergy analyses neglect storage-related physics. Therefore, they do not provide insights into transient processes. Moreover, the results may not be thermodynamically correct because the integrity of the physics does not hold. In this study, we first examined why unsteady-state exergy analysis is required for systems in the built environment. Then, we conducted the unsteady-state exergy analysis of externally and internally insulated building envelopes under a 24-h periodic environmental boundary condition. This was based on a methodology that numerically solves the energy, entropy, and exergy equations, where thermodynamic integrity, including exergy storage, is fully established. We compared the spatiotemporal exergetic behavior of the two envelopes from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. In terms of exergy flow, storage, and consumption, the exergetic behavioral difference and its physical rationale were detailed. The spatiotemporal exergetic behavior of the two envelopes demonstrated a sharp contrast. In particular, the wasted exergy flow from the outer surface into the surrounding environment was significantly larger in the internally insulated envelope than in the externally insulated envelope. Additionally, the exergy stored in the internal layer, which positively affects indoor air conditioning, was much larger in the externally insulated envelope than that in the internally insulated envelope. The insights obtained can contribute to improving building thermal design and creating more efficient operation strategies for energy systems.},

abstract = {In many countries, our lives are lived under a roof. The indoor space is constantly growing and its thermal conditions are kept relatively stable, within comfort requirements, by a variety of passive strategies and mechanical systems. Despite the many energy-efficiency programmes and conservation efforts, the inevitable consequence of the rise in complexity of the built environment is its increasing energy consumption, which poses urgent sustainability concerns. Within this scenario, many optimisation methods are attempted in building design. Among them, exergy analysis - with its roots in thermal power plants - provides a quantification of energy quality and a deeper insight into the causes of inefficiencies. However, buildings are substantially different from machines and some fundamental aspects of their exergy analysis are controversial, such as the impact of the reference-state selection on a dynamic study, or the practical benefits of achieving high exergy efficiencies. Exergy assessments are complex and do not currently hold a prominent role in building design. Nonetheless, second-law approaches preserve their attractiveness and many possible methods are still unexplored. After acknowledging the thermodynamic differences between buildings and power machines and their particular aims, a simplified theoretical framework (built on the current methods) is proposed and formally compared to a state-of-the-art dynamic exergy analysis. The indoor environment is recognised as the fulcrum of all building energy interactions and the reference to assess energy quality. A case study shows the quantitative differences between the proposed idea and the classical approach for the first fundamental steps of the building energy chain from the exergy demand to the emission system. Keeping the design focus on exploiting the local exergy budget, rather than minimising consumption, contributes towards flexible and low-cost sustainable buildings for integrated energy systems. Substantial further research, assisted by virtual representations and real-world testing, is required to explore meanings and practical implications of the proposed perspective.},

WWW: http://www.digital-recordings.com Abstract Darwin's Theory of Evolution [4,5,7] explains how and why life evolved [9,10]. However, some aspects of this theory are still not clear [4,5,7,8,12,14,15]. According to Darwin ,natural selection allows the strongest and most fit species to survive in a particular environment [9,10]. What remains to be answered is how these complex systems (organisms) were first formed and how they maintain their presence on Earth. It is obvious that the entropy of the Biosphere is decreasing continuously (at least it was before the industrial revolution and deforestation).This means that the matter involved in the formation of the Biosphere is getting more and more organized (less random). It was pointed out by many that life seems to defy the II Law of Thermodynamics, which states, that entropy of any system should be increasing [4,5,6,7]. Several attempts were made to explain this striking phenomenon on the basis of the "Theory of Complexity", which suggest, that there are undiscovered laws of nature which are responsible for "Self-Organization" of organisms and the Biosphere [4,5,6,7]. This paper explains the principles responsible for the formation and maintenance of life on Earth and shows that there is no violation of the II Law of Thermodynamics in the case of organisms and the Biosphere.},

abstract = {The concept of available energy, as defined by Gibbs is revisited. Being more general, this concept of available energy differs from that referred to commonly by the same name, or as "exergy" or "availability." He gave representations of available energy for two circumstances. The first was the available energy of a "body," for the case when a body, alone, is in a nonequilibrium condition and therefore has energy available. In turn, he presented the available energy of "the body and medium," for the energy that is available because a body is not in equilibrium with some arbitrarily specified medium or "reference environment." Gibbs' did not present formulas to represent available energy. His representations were verbal descriptions regarding surfaces, curves and lines. Although his verbiage was augmented by some graphics, visualization of the geometrical entities he described depended largely on the imagination of the reader. In Part I, we take advantage of modern graphics software to illustrate more vividly not only the available energy he described verbally but also his interesting concepts of "available vacuum" and "capacity for entropy." We argue that all of these concepts are equivalent. Since Gibbs, representations with formulas have been developed and are common for the "available energy of body and medium." Gaggioli has developed formulas which are more general, to represent "the available energy of the body (alone)" and to assign an exergy to subsystems of the body as a measure of each subsystem's contribution to the available energy. In contrast to the available energy, exergy is an additive property, so that balance equations can be written. This exergy is independent of any "reference environment, " which is important both theoretically and practically because of its relevance to proper selection of "the dead state. " In those special cases when the dead state is one in equilibrium with a "reference environment," this more generalized exergy encompasses that concept called (today) exergy in textbooks and journals.},

abstract = {Energy resources and their utilization intimately relate to sustainable development. In attaining sustainable development, increasing the energy efficiencies of processes utilizing sustainable energy resources plays an important role. The utilization of renewable energy offers a wide range of exceptional benefits. There is also a link between exergy and sustainable development. A sustainable energy system may be regarded as a cost-efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy system that effectively utilizes local resources and networks. Exergy analysis has been widely used in the design, simulation and performance evaluation of energy systems. The present study comprehensively reviews exergetic analysis and performance evaluation of a wide range of renewable energy resources (RERs) for the first time to the best of the author's knowledge. In this regard, general relations (i.e., energy, exergy, entropy and exergy balance equations along with exergy efficiency, exergetic improvement potential rate and some thermodynamic parameters, such as fuel depletion ratio, relative irreversibility, productivity lack and exergetic factor) used in the analysis are presented first. Next, exergetically analyzed and evaluated RERs include (a) solar energy systems; (a1) solar collector applications such as solar water heating systems, solar space heating and cooling, solar refrigeration, solar cookers, industrial process heat, solar desalination systems and solar thermal power plants), (a2) photovoltaics (PVs) and (a3) hybrid (PV/thermal) solar collectors, (b) wind energy systems, (c) geothermal energy systems, (c1) direct utilization (district heating, geothermal or ground-source heat pumps, greenhouses and drying) and (c2) indirect utilization (geothermal power plants), (d) biomass, (e) other renewable energy systems, and (f) country based RERs. Studies conducted on these RERs are then compared with the previously ones in tabulated forms, while the Grassmann (or exergy flow) diagrams, which are a very useful representation of exergy flows and losses, for some RERs are given. Finally, the conclusions are presented. It is expected that this comprehensive study will be very beneficial to everyone involved or interested in the exergetic design, simulation, analysis and performance assessment of RERs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
