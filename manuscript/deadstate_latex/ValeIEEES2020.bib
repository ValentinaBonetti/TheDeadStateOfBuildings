abstract = {In the exergy analysis of the built environment, particularly for a system with large heat capacity and low thermal conductivity, such as building envelopes, consideration of physics associated with the entropy and exergy storages is increasingly important. However, steady-state exergy analyses neglect storage-related physics. Therefore, they do not provide insights into transient processes. Moreover, the results may not be thermodynamically correct because the integrity of the physics does not hold. In this study, we first examined why unsteady-state exergy analysis is required for systems in the built environment. Then, we conducted the unsteady-state exergy analysis of externally and internally insulated building envelopes under a 24-h periodic environmental boundary condition. This was based on a methodology that numerically solves the energy, entropy, and exergy equations, where thermodynamic integrity, including exergy storage, is fully established. We compared the spatiotemporal exergetic behavior of the two envelopes from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. In terms of exergy flow, storage, and consumption, the exergetic behavioral difference and its physical rationale were detailed. The spatiotemporal exergetic behavior of the two envelopes demonstrated a sharp contrast. In particular, the wasted exergy flow from the outer surface into the surrounding environment was significantly larger in the internally insulated envelope than in the externally insulated envelope. Additionally, the exergy stored in the internal layer, which positively affects indoor air conditioning, was much larger in the externally insulated envelope than that in the internally insulated envelope. The insights obtained can contribute to improving building thermal design and creating more efficient operation strategies for energy systems.},

@article{Gaggioli2012,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance for the selection of the dead state for exergy analysis, guidance that is especially important in applications to energy-conversion and materials processing plant engineering, and to ecology. First, the general definition of the dead state is provided, based on the concept of ‘the available energy of a body' as originally presented by Gibbs. Gibbs ‘body' can be any overall system, no matter how complex and a crucial point is that there is no need to include or have a ‘reference environment.' On this groundwork, criteria underlying the selection of the appropriate dead state for a variety of practical engineering systems are referred to; while these cases are not exhaustive, they provide examples of the rationale for selection of an appropriate dead state for any case. Finally, the implications and relevance of the dead state on applications of exergy considerations to the issues of ecology and sustainability are discussed.},

@article{Rosen2004,
abstract = {This study deals with the effects on the results of energy and exergy analyses of variations in dead-state properties, and involves two main tasks: (i) examination of the sensitivities of energy and exergy values to the choice of the dead-state properties and (ii) analysis of the sensitivities of the results of energy and exergy analyses of complex systems to the choice of dead-state properties. A case study of a coal-fired electrical generating station is considered to illustrate the actual influences. The results indicate that the sensitivities of energy and exergy values and the results of energy and exergy analyses to reasonable variations in dead-state properties are sufficiently small that the findings, conclusions and recommendations based on such analyses usually are not significantly affected by the property variations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier SAS.
